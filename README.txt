PURPOSE:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A DBC student interpretation of the classic game, Battleship.

	Rules:

		- The game is played between two players.
		- Each player has a 8 x 8 board with rows labeled 1 - 8 and columns labeled A - H.
		- Players have their own fleets of ships and arrange them on their own boards. The opponents board and ship placement is not visable.
		- Players take turns firing on their opponent's ships (if the player lands a hit, they keep firing until they miss).
		- Shot locations are called out by referencing board coordinates (e.g., "A3", "B6", etc).
		- On a board, shots that miss are represented with a / and hits are represented with an X.
		- Ships are sunk when they've been hit a number of times equal to their size (i.e., the opponent has fired on each board location occupied by the ship).
